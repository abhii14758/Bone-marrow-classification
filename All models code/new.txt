The automatic identification of leukemia cancer cells through the use of machine learning techniques with image processing methods forms the basis of this study. The approach includes the extraction of features from images of blood cells received from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). The study's dataset comes from microscopic pictures of blood cells. The identification of character-istics that improve the detection of cancer cells includes the existence of nearby nuclei and anomalies in the nucleus' shape. Gradient Boosting Decision Tree achieved the most significant accuracy of 85.2% when combined with 90% sensi-tivity and 60% specificity , when further machine learning approaches like Sup-port Vector Machine were used [19]. 

The research focused on a dataset that included 44 control children and 50 pediatric ALL patients from the Children Hospital and Institute of Child Health in Lahore. The dataset included clinical characteristics including CBC, LFTs, RFTs, and ALL type, as well as qualitative information like age and sex. Environmental aspects that were taken into account included housing, social standing, and availability to filtered drinking water. From every subject, fifteen characteristics were gathered. After applying four supervised machine learning techniques (ML): CART, Random Forest, Gradient Boost Machine, and C5.0 De-cision Tree, the best accuracy was obtained by CART (99.83%), followed by C5.0 (98.6%), Random Forest (94.44%), and GBM (95.61%). The model was validated through a ten-fold cross-validation, and CART achieved an overall accuracy of 87.4%, as well as sensitivity and specificity of 0.89 and 1, respectively[20]. 

The goal of the study is to use machine learning and image analysis to recognize and classify acute lymphocytic leukemia. The study employed the ALL-IDB1 dataset, which consists of 108 pictures of blood smears. The suggested methodology consists of preprocessing with CLAHE, segmentation via color-based k-means clustering, feature extraction, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction. The dataset is then split 70-30, with 70% being used for training and 30% for testing. Finally, machine learning algorithms like SVM, KNN, and BPNN are applied. SVM with an RBF kernel outperformed the others in terms of accuracy, achieving 96% with 92.64% sensitivity[21]. 

The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), which supplied more than 1700 malignant blood cells, gave the dataset of 500 peripheral blood smear pictures containing acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leu-kemia cells used in this research. For binary classification, histogram-oriented gradient (HOG) features and local binary patterns (LBP) were retrieved. Accura-cy rates of 97% and 98% were attained by combining CNNs such as VGG16 and DenseNet121 with SVM classifiers using transfer learning. The AIIMS and ALL-IDB databases were combined to create a heterogeneous dataset. Using SVM and ResNet50, a three-class classification model achieved 95% accuracy. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, and AUC were included in the numerical analysis, which was supplemented by t-SNE qualitative analysis for further insights.

This study provides a comprehensive review of the use of deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) approaches for ALL detection and categoriza-tion. A multi-step strategy comprising image preprocessing, white blood cell segmentation, and feature extraction is described in the work in order to distin-guish between cancerous and healthy cells, recognizing the need of identifying such rapidly spreading blood cancers. Although classical machine learning tech-niques like support vector machines and random forests have been used, recent advances in deep learning—specifically, transfer learning models like Mo-bileNetV2 and ResNet—show encouraging outcomes even with limited da-tasets.The study acknowledges several challenges, such as insufficiently labeled data and subtype classification complexity. It suggests that future research focus-es on improving dataset size, segmentation approaches, and the development of DL architectures that improve early ALL identification. [23]. 

The application of machine learning (ML) techniques for the analysis of peripheral blood smear (PBS) images in the early diagnosis and classification of leukemia is the primary objective of this systematic review. The review evaluated 116 papers from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar using keywords related to machine learning, leukemia, PBS pictures, detection, diagnosis, and classification. Of those, 16 were included in the analy-sis. The results demonstrated the potential of ML with a >97% detection rate, emphasizing the improved sensitivity and precision of DL. The review highlights the difficulties with manual PBS examination and suggests ML automation. It examines machine learning (ML) methods such as feature extraction, segmenta-tion (thresholding, clustering, object identification), and overfitting risks with limited datasets. The paper ends with a need for a larger, more reliable dataset, highlighting the necessity for additional developments in ML-based leukemia diagnosis[24].

The study suggested a novel method for categorizing acute lympho-blastic leukemia (ALL). This work presented a novel method for categorizing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using deep learning techniques. Specifically focusing on L2 and L3 blast morphology, the paper emphasizes how crucial seg-mentation is to accurate classification. The authors presented a deep learning strategy that employs the AlexNet model with Convolutional Neural Net-work (CNN) architecture to classify ALL into its subtypes and usual situations. With an astounding accuracy of 97.78%, their entire technology displayed processing time efficiency. The proposed method prepares images using HSV color space preprocessing, constructs models using transfer learning, and segments data using a simple threshold [25]. 

In addition to introducing a novel weight factor (Wf), which is essential to remarkable computational efficiency and system performance, the paper work introduces a unique deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)-based archi-tecture that enhances detection and classification performance. The proposed approach outperforms prior networks with high accuracy (97.18%), precision (98.52%), specificity (98.46%), F1 score (0.9719), and area under the curve (AUC) (0.9718). The research findings demonstrate the superiority of the deep CNN framework over other popular models, including ResNet18, GoogLeNet, and MobileNetV2. The study concludes that their proposed framework performs extraordinarily well in terms of classification, making it the best choice, even though it requires somewhat longer computation times [26].

The study offered a novel approach to increase the accuracy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) detection and classification that is based on adap-tive unsharpening and deep learning techniques. To tackle the critical problem of prompt detection of ALL, the research examines white blood cells in peripheral blood samples, focusing on lymphoblasts with various morphologies. The authors offer a novel technique that enhances sharpness by using adaptive image pro-cessing and shallow Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to modify the un-sharpening algorithm's parameters. Their technique combines image registration to normalize cell radius with focus quality assessment for adaptive unsharpening. Test results on the ALL Image Database demonstrate that the suggested approach greatly increases the accuracy of lympho-blast detection across a variety of deep CNNs, regardless of the specific architecture used [27]. 

In order to detect leukemia in blood samples, the research suggests a revo-lutionary deep learning approach that makes use of microscopic features. In an effort to improve feature representation throughout extraction layers and address the high mortality rate associated with leukemia, a new version of the deep learn-ing technique which includes squeeze and excitation learning is being intro-duced. The study suggests the enhanced representation capabilities of the pro-posed framework through comparisons with current approaches. This study high-lights the importance of the squeeze and excitation learning-based technique for leukemia identification, with results shown on publicly accessible datasets. Fur-ther studies aim to reduce concerns about dataset size by improving the data in the ALL_IDB2 dataset, highlighting the possibility of additional progress in leu-kemia identification via deep learning techniques.
